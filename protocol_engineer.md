## About Mirage

### What is Mirage?

Mirage is a privacy-first, decentralized peer-to-peer network for Ethereum. It enables probabilistic privacy via an off-chain intent system and on-chain validation. Think of it as a network where people carry out actions on behalf of others in exchange for incentives without revealing who did what.

Public blockchains suffer from a lack of transactional privacy. This gap prevents both individuals and businesses from fully embracing self-custody. Mirage exists to remove that obstacle.

Mirage is not a blockchain, offers no native token and does not offer a canonical network.

### Why Join Mirage?

Mirage is built on obsession. Every detail matters. In privacy, small errors mean total failure. We operate in a domain where the stakes are high: Ethereum secures hundreds of billions in assets. Protecting that privacy is serious work.

If this sounds intimidating, you're not who we're looking for. If it sounds like purpose, read on.

## Founding Protocol Engineer

As the founding protocol engineer, you will be responsible for architecting and optimizing critical infrastructure in a highly adversarial, decentralized environment. This role demands an advanced command of both the Rust programming language and Ethereum's protocol internals. Your primary responsibility will be the development of node software capable of monitoring the Ethereum mempool, validating the cryptographic integrity of off-chain intents, executing them on-chain with precision, and emitting verifiable proofs. In a very literal sense, your contributions will constitute the foundational machinery of the Mirage network.

**What Youâ€™ll Do:**

- Build and maintain a performant Rust node for a decentralized network
- Implement and optimize cryptographic proof systems
- Develop low-level interfaces to Ethereum

**You Should Have:**

- 2+ years working on low-level web3 protocol development
- Strong Rust fluency with real-world output
- Deep understanding of Ethereum internals, especially consensus
- Comfort implementing cryptography from specs
- Experience with distributed systems in dynamic environments

**Bonus Points:**

- Experience with libp2p or related stacks
- Familiarity with EVM internals
- Work in ZK or privacy-preserving tech
- OSS contributions in blockchain privacy spaces

If you're interested in joining Mirage, please reach out via email to mirage@codeandstate.com and include the following: full name, GitHub or relevant code repositories, resume or CV, a brief note on why you wish to join us, any relevant links (e.g., X, LinkedIn, personal site).

We're looking for clarity, intent, and proof of work.
