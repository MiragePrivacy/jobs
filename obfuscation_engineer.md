## About Mirage

### What is Mirage?

Mirage is a privacy-first, decentralized peer-to-peer network for Ethereum. It enables probabilistic privacy via an off-chain intent system and on-chain validation. Think of it as a network where people carry out actions on behalf of others in exchange for incentives without revealing who did what.

Public blockchains suffer from a lack of transactional privacy. This gap prevents both individuals and businesses from fully embracing self-custody. Mirage exists to remove that obstacle.

Mirage is not a blockchain, offers no native token and does not offer a canonical network.

### Why Join Mirage?

Mirage is built on obsession. Every detail matters. In privacy, small errors mean total failure. We operate in a domain where the stakes are high: Ethereum secures hundreds of billions in assets. Protecting that privacy is serious work.

If this sounds intimidating, you're not who we're looking for. If it sounds like purpose, read on.

## Founding Obfuscation Engineer

As the founding obfuscation engineer, you will operate within an intensely adversarial domain in which all produced artifacts are fully transparent and subject to public scrutiny. Your objective is not to conceal code, but to render reverse engineering prohibitively expensive. This requires a high degree of technical sophistication and strategic creativity. You will engage daily with advanced obfuscation methodologies, conduct empirical experiments to assess their efficacy, deconstruct and analyze existing Ethereum smart contracts at the bytecode level, and iteratively refine a robust, deterministic EVM obfuscator.

**What Youâ€™ll Do:**

- Architect and implement a deterministic EVM bytecode obfuscator.
- Design rigorous test frameworks to validate correctness.
- Apply formal methods to verify safety and resilience.

**You Should Have:**

- 2+ years in EVM bytecode-level tooling or reverse engineering
- 2+ years of Rust experience (open source, professional, or personal)
- Proven work in compilers, obfuscators, or binary analysis tools
- Comfort with adversarial design and p2p threat models
- Clear, technical writing skills

**Bonus Points:**

- Cryptographic engineering background
- Understanding of Ethereum consensus and execution
- Academic or independent work in compilers, PL theory, or verification

If you're interested in joining Mirage, please reach out via email to mirage@codeandstate.com and include the following: full name, GitHub or relevant code repositories, resume or CV, a brief note on why you wish to join us, any relevant links (e.g., X, LinkedIn, personal site).

We're looking for clarity, intent, and proof of work.
