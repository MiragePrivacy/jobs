## About Mirage

### What is Mirage?

Mirage is a privacy-first, decentralized peer-to-peer network for Ethereum. It enables probabilistic privacy via an off-chain intent system and on-chain validation. Think of it as a network where people carry out actions on behalf of others in exchange for incentives without revealing who did what.

Public blockchains suffer from a lack of transactional privacy. This gap prevents both individuals and businesses from fully embracing self-custody. Mirage exists to remove that obstacle.

Mirage is not a blockchain and offers no native token.

### Why Join Mirage?

Mirage is built on obsession. Every detail matters. In privacy, small errors mean total failure. We operate in a domain where the stakes are high: Ethereum secures hundreds of billions in assets. Protecting that privacy is serious work.

If this sounds intimidating, you're not who we're looking for. If it sounds like purpose, read on.
