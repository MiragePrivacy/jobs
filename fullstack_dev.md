**About Mirage**

**What is Mirage?**

Mirage is a privacy-first, decentralized peer-to-peer network for Ethereum. It enables stablecoin privacy via an off-chain intent system and on-chain validation. Think of it as a network where people carry out actions on behalf of others in exchange for incentives without revealing who did what.

Public blockchains suffer from a lack of transactional privacy. This gap prevents both individuals and businesses from fully embracing self-custody. Mirage exists to remove that obstacle.

**Why Join Mirage?**

Mirage is built on obsession with craft. In privacy engineering, every detail matters, and even small errors mean total failure. We operate in a domain where the stakes are real: Ethereum secures hundreds of billions in assets, and protecting user privacy in this environment is serious work.

This makes Mirage a uniquely intense place to build.

**Full Stack Developer**

As the full-stack developer, you will build the interface through which users interact with Mirage. You will architect high-performance web applications that handle sensitive cryptographic operations while maintaining exceptional usability in an adversarial environment

**What You'll Do:**

- Build and maintain Mirage's web application with whatever stack makes sense (currently considering Next.js/React, Svelte, or similar)
- Implement client-side cryptographic operations with performance and security constraints
- Collaborate with protocol engineers to translate complex technical capabilities into intuitive user experiences
- Design and build wallet integrations and transaction flows

**Requirements:**

- 2+ years building production web applications that actually work
- Strong JavaScript/TypeScript skills and understanding of type safety in critical applications
- Experience integrating Web3 libraries (viem, wagmi, or similar)
- Understanding of asynchronous operations and client-side state management
- Track record of shipping polished, user-facing products
- Willingness to work with whatever framework fits the job best
- Understanding of Ethereum fundamentals (accounts, transactions, gas, signing)

**Nice to Have:**

- Contributions to open-source crypto projects
- Strong opinions on framework tradeoffs backed by real experience
