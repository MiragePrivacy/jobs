## About Mirage

### What is Mirage?

Mirage is a privacy-first, decentralized peer-to-peer network for Ethereum. It enables stablecoin privacy via an off-chain intent system and on-chain validation. Think of it as a network where people carry out actions on behalf of others in exchange for incentives without revealing who did what.

Public blockchains suffer from a lack of transactional privacy. This gap prevents both individuals and businesses from fully embracing self-custody. Mirage exists to remove that obstacle.

### Why Join Mirage?

Mirage is built on obsession with craft. In privacy engineering, every detail matters, and even small errors mean total failure. We operate in a domain where the stakes are real: Ethereum secures hundreds of billions in assets, and protecting user privacy in this environment is serious work.

This makes Mirage a uniquely intense place to build.

## Community Lead

As our community lead, you will build and nurture Mirage's community from zero. You will translate complex cryptographic concepts into compelling narratives, establish credibility in crypto communities, and articulate why privacy matters without resorting to hype.

### What You'll Do:

- Create content strategies that educate users on privacy and Mirage's technical approach
- Manage community engagement and translate technical developments into accessible updates
- Identify and engage with key voices in privacy, Ethereum, and decentralization
- Moderate technical discussions while maintaining nuance and depth

### Requirements:

- Proven track record building crypto communities from scratch with measurable results
- Strong X (Twitter) presence with genuine traction in crypto circles
- Deep understanding of Ethereum with real technical fluency
- Ability to explain privacy primitives and cryptographic concepts in plain language
- Experience moderating technical discussions without losing nuance
- Comfort operating in early-stage, high-ambiguity environments

### Nice to Have:

- Personal involvement in privacy-focused projects or DAOs
- Technical background or ability to read and understand protocol specifications
- Established relationships with privacy researchers, developers, or key Ethereum community members
- Experience with ZK or privacy tech communities
- Content creation skills (writing, video, or visual)
- Experience growing communities in adjacent domains (DeFi, infrastructure, tooling)
